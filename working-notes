Things to fix:
Player display does not remove a player when he logs off DONE
Online PLayers: in the status bar shows 0 because it goes off new players just logged in and not current players DONE
Down arrow in the players list is not working on os x DONE
When you are scrolling up through the chat and someone posts something new it jumps you down to the bottom
Word wrap is not working

Things to add:
Plugins tab:
 list of plugins, when you select one it shows all text tagged with that name
 
In the future:
Remote connection (SSH) use paramiko/pexpect to do this
Enable/disable plugins
Grey out start/stop button
Put the fetchNewLines method in its own thread and send out signals when it finds new lines. also, fuck threads
In username drop down add option to view only that users chat posts
Players list totally refreshes each time a new player is added. This isn't that big of a deal when there aren't too many people on, but it could become a problem for large servers (>20)
